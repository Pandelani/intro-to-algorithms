    "As a twist on the sorting problem, we will now look at a different kind of cost analysis that the authors call the 'hiring problem'. Imagine an open position and a list of candidates. You must interview each candidate, and replace the person you have hired if they are a better candidate. Interviewing a candidate has a small cost, and hiring them has a large cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this more computerish terms, we want to iterate through an array, at each step storing the best candidate and . There is a small cost for comparing a value in the array, and a high cost for storing it. We might write this in pseudocode as:\n",

Our expected number of hires in the worst case is equal to the total number of candidates. In randomized order, the expected number of hires drops.
